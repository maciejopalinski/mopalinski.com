I am a software engineer with a passion for web development and embedded programming. I also specialize in system administration and DevOps. I have experience with a [wide range of technologies]({{< ref "./technologies.md" >}}).

I am a big fan of [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and I try to contribute to the community as much as I can. I almost exclusively use free and open-source software on a daily basis. I am a big fan of Linux and I use it as my primary operating system.

I am interested in electronics. I have experience with designing, building, reverse engineering electronic circuits and manufacturing [PCBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board).
